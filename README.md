# Graypaper: The JAM Specification

The description and formal specification of the Jam protocol, a potential successor to the Polkadot Relay chain.

Build with xelatex.


## This repo adds a mobile version 

Margins, single column, a bit more line spacing. 

To build (Ubuntu 22.04)

```bash

# sudo apt-get install texlive-xetex texlive-fonts-extra texlive-bibtex-extra biber

# first time
xelatex graypaper-mobile.tex
biber graypaper-mobile 

# subsequently
xelatex graypaper-mobile.tex
```

## Stuff to replicate to PolkaJam

- Beefy root and accumulate-result hash.
- Judgements
- Using posterior assignments.

## Ideas to consider

- optional `on_report` entry point
- Remove assignments from state - no need for it to be there as it's derivable from $\eta_2$ alone.
- Work Package should be Merklized on pre-stated boundary points.
  - Add BoundedVec<(ServiceId, u32, u32), MAX_POINTS> to WorkPackage
  - Construct Merkle trie for Work Package and put root in IsAuthorized
- Think harder about if the recent blocks, availability timeouts & anchor stuff is affected by using timeslot rather than height.
- Make memo bounded, rather than fixed.
- Lookup anchor: maybe it should be 48 hours since lookup anchor can already be up to 24 hours after reporting and we want something available up to 24 hours after that?

### Extra DA

DA lasts 28 days instead of 24h.

WP has additional field `manifest: Vec<ManifestEntry>`:
```rust
struct Commitment {
  hash: Hash,
  len: u32,
  erasure_root: Hash,
}
type CommitmentTreeRoot = Hash; //binary Merkle tree of `Commitment` leaves
struct HashCommitment {
  len: u32,
  hash: Hash,
}
enum PackageManifestEntry {
  Export(Vec<u8>),
  Import(Commitment),
  Renew(Commitment),
  ExportCache(Vec<u8>),
  ImportCache(Hash),
  RenewCache { len: u32, hash: Hash },
}
```

WR specification has extra field of type `manifest_root: CommitmentTreeRoot`.

Affinity for validator indexes minimizes renewal xfer costs.

Guarantor ECs WP, each proc-export/export/renewal; checks each import chunk is available for > 8h and fetches.
Guarantor distributes chunks of proc-exports/exports/renewals.
Auditor:
- downloads/reconstitutes WP and all nodes of `manifest_root` and downloads/reconstitutes all exports/renewals.
- ECs WP/exports/renewals

Guaranteeing involves:
- Fetching/Reconstucting all Imports & Renews
- Fetching all ImportCaches & RenewCaches
- Executing
- ErasureCoding all Exports & GenExports & Renews
- Distributing chunks of all Exports & GenExports & Renews
- Hashing all ExportCaches & GenExportCaches
- Distributing data of all ExportCaches & GenExportCaches & RenewCaches
- Merklizing ErasureRoots/Hashes to create WR's `manifest_root`

Auditing involves (10 of):
- Fetching/Reconstucting all Exports, Imports & Renews
- Fetching all ExportCaches & RenewCaches
- ErasureCoding all Exports (Renews & Imports should already be audited)
- Executing
- ErasureCoding all GenExports
- Hashing all GenExportCaches
- Merklizing ErasureRoots/Hashes to verify WR's `manifest_root`


`refine` has new host-call:
- `export(payload: &[u8], cache: bool)`
- Calling this introduces an additional node in the manifest tree (`manifest_root`), iff the overall manifest size is  constraints would break then the call fails. The WP does not become invalid.

`refine` has new argument:
- `, manifest_payloads: Vec<(Hash, Vec<u8>)>`

const BASE: u32 = 2048; // Example - might be less.



let dist = |WP| + SUM_{Export(payload) in M}(payload.len() + BASE) + SUM_{Renew(c) in M}(c.len + BASE) + SUM_{ExportCache(c) in M}(c.len() * 341 + BASE) + SUM_{RenewCache{len, ..} in M}(len * 341 + BASE)

let ecode = |WP| + SUM_{Export(payload) in M}(payload.len() + BASE) + SUM_{Renew(c) in M}(c.len + BASE) + SUM_{ExportCache(c) in M}(c.len() * 341 + BASE) + SUM_{RenewCache{len, ..} in M}(len * 341 + BASE)
let reco = |WP| + SUM_{Import(c) in M, Renew(c) in M}(c.len + BASE)

WP is valid iff: max(dist, reco) <= 8MB
WP is available iff: all imports are in DA now and will still be in DA 8 hours from now


## Additional work
- [ ] Proper gas schedule.
- [ ] Networking protocol.
- [ ] Off-chain sub-protocols:
  - [ ] Better integration to Grandpa
  - [ ] Better description of Beefy
- [ ] Full definition of Bandersnatch RingVRF.
- [x] Independent definition of PVM.
- [ ] PVM:
  - [ ] Aux registers?
  - [ ] Move to 64-bit?
  - [ ] No pages mappable in first 64 KB 

% No persistent distance between parts as in eth, cos, dot etc

% A set of independent, sequential, asynchronously interacting 32-octet state machines each of whose transitions lasts around 2 seconds of webassembly computation if a predetermined and fixed program and whose transition arguments are 5 MB. While well-suited to the verification of substrate blockchains, it is otherwise quite limiting.

  - [x] Specify requirement of validators to sign.
- [x] Define audit process.
  - [x] Erasure coding root must be correct
  - [x] This means we cannot assume that the WP hash can be inverted.
  - [x] Instead, we assume that we can collect 1/3 chunks and combine to produce *some* data
  - [x] Then we check:
    - [x] if that hashes to the WP hash.
    - [x] if the erasure-coded chunks merklise into a tree of the given root.
  - [x] If so we continue.
  - [x] NOTE: The above should be done in guarantor stage also.
- [x] Auditing: Always finish once announced.
- [x] Judgements: Should cancel work-report from Rho prior to accumulation.
- [x] Signed judgements should not include guarantor keys;
  - [x] Judgement extrinsic should use from rho.
- [x] Check "Which History" section and ensure it mentions possibility for reversion via judgement.
  - [x] No reversion beyond finalized
